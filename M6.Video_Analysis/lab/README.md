# Video Surveillance for Road Traffic Monitoring

This project aims to learn the basic concepts and techniques related to video sequence processing, primarily for
surveillance applications. For traffic monitoring, we will focus on video sequences from outdoor scenarios. In video
surveillance, the following video processing techniques will be applied: background modelling, moving object
segmentation, motion estimation and compensation, and video object tracking.
